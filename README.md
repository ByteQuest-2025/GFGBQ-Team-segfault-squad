# 1️⃣ Problem Statement

**Design & Develop an AI-Driven Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Automation and Workflow Orchestration**

Build a platform where autonomous agents collaborate to interpret user inputs, make intelligent decisions, execute automated workflows, and interact with a frontend dashboard in real-time. The system should enable users to configure automation pipelines visually and trigger agents to process tasks using connected services like Redis and n8n automation workflows.

## 📌 Project Overview

Segfault Squad’s **Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestrator** is an AI-assisted automation platform that allows users to define workflows, engage autonomous agents, and visualize outcomes through a modern frontend dashboard.  

The system integrates:
- A **Frontend UI** for user interactions and control panel
- Intelligent **agents** to perform tasks & decisions
- A central **brain** controlling workflows
- **n8n data** for automation flows
- **Redis** for caching and state management
- Utility **scripts** supporting deployment and runtime processes

This architecture allows for flexible task automation, dynamic response handling, and easy integration with external APIs and services.
